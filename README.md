# learning-spring

Using Spring Boot as a mechanism to learn the basics of Spring framework. 

Started by using Spring data and loaded an embedded database, as well as a remote database and repositories that were used as an ORM to get data out of the database with little code. 

Leveraged the IoC container to inject dependencies into upstream classes. 

Built a webpage using the Spring framework.

Built some ReSTful webservices.
